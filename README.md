# Read me!

With this little project I want to learn some basics of the [React framework](https://react.dev).
My vision is to make a map to click on and following to get some data about the weather of the current location.

For this I use:
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) (map) - already in project
* [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (data for map) - already in project
* [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) (weather data) -  already in project
